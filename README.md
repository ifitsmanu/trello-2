# Trello-2.0 Next.js, Zustand, Drag'n'Drop and Appwrite with TypeScript

This repository holds the code for an advanced Trello clone built using Next.js, Zustand for state management, a beautiful Drag'n'Drop interface, and Appwrite as backend, all powered by TypeScript.

## Project Description

This project is a feature-rich Trello clone with a clean and intuitive interface. It offers similar functionalities that you would expect from a project management tool. It includes features like creating boards, adding lists within boards, creating cards under lists, and moving cards from one list to another with a smooth drag and drop experience. All these features are built using modern tech stack for the best performance and user experience.

## Tech Stack

1. **Next.js**: A React framework for building JavaScript applications with server-side rendering and generating static websites for React-based web applications.
2. **Zustand**: A small, fast, and scaleable bearbones state-management solution.
3. **Drag'n'Drop**: This functionality makes it easy to move tasks/cards around for a more dynamic and intuitive project management.
4. **Appwrite**: A secure end-to-end backend server for Web, Mobile, and Flutter developers to help build scalable apps.
5. **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional types. It provides enhanced code quality and understandability.
